    "Many people around the world develop gambling addictions, and one of the toughest variations of this addiction can be compulsively gambling on the lottery. But, through the use of an app, a medical institute is aiming to help change this behavior. This app will help users estimate their odds of winning the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49). We will also reference [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) containing historical lottery data, so the user can compare their predictions to past results."
